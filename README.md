### This is a Blockchain based Certificate Verification system. This is actually a forked project, which i have audited and still auditing....
The project clearly demonstrates how an authenticated institute/organization/certification authority can generate certificates for their candidates and how any user on internet can register an account in the platform and verify those certificates using either a  corresponding certificate-id or simply using its pdf-format.

### Tech Stack or Frameworks used are : 

```
1. Frontend  :  Streamlit 
2. Solidity Smart contracts 
3. Firebase cloud for user authentication + Python API wrapper called "Pyrebase"
4. Ganache-CLI for emulating an Ethereum Blockchain locally. 
5. Truffle suite for smart contract development/deployment. 
6. Pinata account setup and API key for managing certificates in IPFS. 
7. Web3 module in python to connect with Ethereum node locally and interact with the blockchain. 
8. Other python based modules : Pdfplumber, Pillow, Requests, etc.
```

#### Requirements : 
> 1. Python version 3.11.x
> 2. Node version 21.0.0
