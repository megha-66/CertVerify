#### This is a Blockchain based Certificate Verification system. 
##### The project clearly demonstrates how an authenticated institude/organization/certification-authority can generate certificate for their candidates andhow any user on internet can register an account in the platform and verify those certificates using either a certificate-id or a pdf-format. 
### Tech Stack or Frameworks used are : 
> 1. Frontend  : ``` Streamlit ```
> 2. Solidity Smart contracts 
> 3. Firebase cloud for user authentication + Pyhon API wrapper called "Pyrebase"
> 4. Ganache-CLI for emulating an Ethereum Blockchain locally. 
> 5. Truffle suite for smart contract development/deployment. 
> 6. Pinata account setup and API key for managing certificates in IPFS. 
> 7. Web3 module in python to connect with Ethereum node locally and interact with the blockchain. 
> 8. Other python based modules : Pdfplumber, Pillow, Requests, etc. 

##### Requirements : 
> 1. Python version 3.11.x
> 2. Node version 21.0.0
